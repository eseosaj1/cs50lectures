        <h1>ATO Background Information</h1>
            <p>ATO process is a comprehensive assessment and/or evaluation of an information system policies, technical and non-technical security components, documentation, supplemental safeguards, policies, and vulnerabilities. The ATO process establishes the extent to which a particular design and control implementation, meet a set of specified security requirements defined by the organization, government guidelines, and federal mandates into a formal authorization package. This authorization package is reviewed by the Authorizing Official (AO) and a formal declaration of an information system accreditation is either granted as an Authorization to Operate (ATO) or ATO with conditions or outright denial of authorization to operate.</p>
            <p>Given the ATO the information system is to operate in a particular security mode using a prescribed set of safeguards and function at an acceptable level of risk to the agency.  Each information system is placed into the information security continuous monitoring program which maintains the ongoing awareness of information security vulnerabilities, and threats to an information system.</p>
        <h2>ATO Steps/Phases</h2>
        <ol>
          <li><h4>Categorization:</h4> Categorize the information systems, i.e., determine the criticality of the information system based on potential adverse impact to the business, to either:</li>
            <ul>
              <li> High risk category</li>
              <li> Moderate risk category</li>
              <li> or Low risk category</li>
            </ul>
          <li><h4>Security control selection:</h4>Select baseline security controls,
            using NIST 800-53 controls as guide.</li>
          <li><h4>Implement security control:</h4> Implement these security controls,
            i.e., implement security controls within the business network environment:-</li>
          <ul>
            <li>- system owner would implement and document selected control</li>
            <li>- system owner would do a self assessment of implemented controls and remediate any findings</li>
            <li>- when satisfy, system will be turn over to technical team for security/technical assessment</li>
          </ul>
          <li><h4>Security Assessment:</h4> Assess the security controls to determine their effectiveness.</li>
          <li><h4>Authorization:</h4>Authorize the system to operate in the enterprise network environment.</li>
          <li><h4>Continuous Monitoring:</h4> monitor authorized system on a continous basis for control effectiveness</li>
